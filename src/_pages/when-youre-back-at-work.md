## When you’re back at work

When you’re back, your employer may set up a return to work meeting.

These are usually just an informal chat about:

- anything that’s changed at work while you were off
- support you may need
- what you’d like other employees to know about your absence
- what must stay confidential

You should also discuss with your employer:

- whether you can have time off for [health appointments](https://acas.org.uk/time-off-for-medical-appointments/)
- if you’re finding it impossible to continue in the same role

Your employer has a duty to support you to remain in your job.
