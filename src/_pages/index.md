## Fit notes and sick pay

Once you’ve received a fit note from your healthcare professional, give it to your employer immediately.

You need to do this to claim sick pay.

You can scan it and email it to your employer. Or you can forward them a digital copy.

### Ask your employer if you’ll get sick pay

Some employers have their own sick pay scheme and you may get full pay for a period of time.

If your employer does not have its own sick pay scheme, check if you’re eligible for [Statutory Sick Pay (SSP)](https://gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay/what-youll-get/).

SSP is £116.75 for 26 weeks.

If you’re not eligible for sick pay, check [other benefits](/benefits-and-other-financial-help/) you can get.
