## If you cannot return or your employer wants to dismiss you

It may not be possible to continue doing the same job as before.

Depending on your employer, some options could be:

- [retraining](#retraining)
- [ill-heath retirement](https://moneyhelper.org.uk/en/pensions-and-retirement/taking-your-pension/early-retirement-because-of-illness-sickness-or-disability/)
- voluntary redundancy

You employer could potentially dismiss you if you have an ongoing or long-term illness that makes it impossible to do your job.

But before this, your employer must:

- consider how to support you, for example, check whether your job itself is making you ill and make changes
- make any reasonable adjustments so that you’re not disadvantaged
- give you reasonable time to recover from illness

Your employer has a legal duty to [support disability (which includes long-term sickness) in the workplace](https://gov.uk/rights-disabled-person/employment/).

Dismissal because of a disability may be unlawful discrimination.

Your long term condition might count as a disability and, if so, you might be able to argue discrimination.

### Get help and legal advice

If your employer is not supporting you, you can get advice and help.

For example, if you’re in a [trade union](https://gov.uk/join-trade-union/), they can represent you when talking to your employer.

There are also other organisations you can contact for free advice:

- [ACAS](https://acas.org.uk/)
- [Citizens Advice](https://citizensadvice.org.uk/)
