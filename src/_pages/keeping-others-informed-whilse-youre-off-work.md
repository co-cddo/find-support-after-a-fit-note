## Keeping others informed while you’re off work

Employers can contact you during sick leave but the amount of contact should be reasonable.

You do not have to tell them private and confidential information, if you do not want to.

Agree what’s appropriate between you. If the contact is too overwhelming for you, you can say that.

You could also have a friend of family member who liaises with your employer on your behalf instead.
