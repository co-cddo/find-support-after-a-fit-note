## Keeping others informed while you’re off work

You may need to stay in touch with people while you are off work. Who you contact and what you tell them depends on how you work.

### If you are employed

Your employer may contact you while you’re off. The contact should be:

- reasonable
- agreed between you and your employer
- based on what feels manageable for you as the employee

You do not have to share private or medical information if you do not want to.

If it’s too much to manage, you can:

- ask for fewer updates
- choose a friend or family member to speak to your employer for you

### If you need help staying in touch with your employer

ACAS is a public body that provides free and impartial advice on workplace rights, rules and best practice.

### If you are self-employed or run a business

If you’re self-employed, a sole trader or run a limited company, you may need to:

- let clients or customers know you’re taking time off
- manage ongoing work or projects
- tell HMRC if your income is reduced
