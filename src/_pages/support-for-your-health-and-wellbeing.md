## Support for your health and wellbeing

If you’re dealing with a health issue, there may be support to help you manage your condition, recover, or return to work.

You don’t need a diagnosis to get help. Some support is condition-specific, but much of it is available to anyone managing their health.

### Talk to someone about your options

Your doctor, nurse or specialist can help you understand what support is available — including help with managing symptoms, getting equipment, or accessing services that make daily life easier.

You might also be eligible for a [personal health budget](https://nhs.uk/nhs-services/help-with-health-costs/what-is-a-personal-health-budget/) from the NHS.   This is money to help you plan and pay for care, treatment, or equipment that meets your needs. If you’re eligible, your NHS team will help you plan how the money is used.
