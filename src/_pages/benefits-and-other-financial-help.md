## Benefits and other financial help

You may get benefits if:

- you need help on top of sick pay
- you’re not eligible for sick pay - for example, you are self-employed
- sick pay has ended

Even if you’re self-employed and don’t get sick pay, you may still be eligible for [New Style Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)](https://gov.uk/employment-support-allowance/eligibility/), [Universal Credit](https://gov.uk/self-employment-and-universal-credit/), or other support depending on your circumstances.

Use a [benefits calculator](https://gov.uk/benefits-calculators/) to work out which benefits you could get and how much you might receive each week.

### Health costs

You may be able to get help with [NHS prescriptions, dental treatment, eye tests and other costs](https://gov.uk/help-nhs-costs/).

### Bills

Check what help is available with the [cost of living if you have a health condition or disability](https://gov.uk/cost-of-living/).

For example you might be able to get:

- your water bill capped through the [Watersure scheme](https://citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/water/problems-with-paying-your-water-bill/watersure-scheme-help-with-paying-water-bills/)
- £150 off energy bills with the [Warm Home Discount Scheme](https://gov.uk/the-warm-home-discount-scheme/)
- a discount on your [broadband bills](https://ofcom.org.uk/phones-and-broadband/saving-money/social-tariffs/), if you’re claiming benefits

### Travel

You may get help with [transport costs](https://gov.uk/financial-help-disabled/vehicles-and-transport/) if you have a disability.
