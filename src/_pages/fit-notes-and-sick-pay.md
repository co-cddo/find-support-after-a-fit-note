## Fit notes and sick pay

You can get a fit note from a healthcare professional, such as your GP, if you’re too unwell to work.

A fit note is a statement from a doctor that says whether you’re well enough to work. You’ll get one if your doctor thinks your health affects your ability to work.

### If you’re employed

You need to give your fit note to your employer as soon as possible. You can scan it and email it, or send a digital copy.

### If you’re self-employed or run a limited company

You do not need to give the fit note to an employer. But you may need it to support a benefits claim, such as Universal Credit or Employment and Support Allowance.

## Check if you can get sick pay or financial support

### If you are employed

If you’re employed, ask your employer if they have a sick pay scheme. Some employers pay full wages for a set time.

If they do not, you might be able to get Statutory Sick Pay (SSP). SSP is £116.75 a week for up to 28 weeks.

### If you are self-employed

If you’re self-employed or run your own limited company, you cannot get SSP, but you may be able to get other financial support.
