## What to do if you can’t return to work or your job has to change

Sometimes it’s not possible to go back to work in the same way as before. This could be because of a health condition, disability or changes to your circumstances. 

Whether you are employed, self-employed or run a business, there is support to help you understand your options and make the next step.

### If you are employed

Your employer must follow the law before they can make any decisions about your job while you’re off sick. They should:

- check whether your work is affecting your health
- make any reasonable adjustments to help you stay in work
- give you reasonable time to recover
- explore other options like retraining, moving to a different role, ill-health retirement, or voluntary redundancy

If your condition is long-term, it may be classed as a disability. Your employer must not discriminate against you. They have a legal duty to support people with disabilities at work under the [Equality Act 2010](https://gov.uk/rights-disabled-person/employment/).

> If you are dismissed because of a disability, this may be unlawful discrimination.

You can find out [what employers must do to support you](https://gov.uk/reasonable-adjustments-for-disabled-workers/).

### Charities who can help with reasonable adjustments at work

You can get advice about your rights and support with making changes at work if you have a health condition or disability.

You can contact these organisations:

- Scope is a disability equality charity who can give you guidance on [how to ask for changes and what to do if your employer says no](https://scope.org.uk/advice-and-support/reasonable-adjustments-at-work/)
- ACAS is a public body that can give you free, impartial advice on workplace rights including [asking for reasonable adjustments](https://acas.org.uk/reasonable-adjustments/).

### If you are self-employed or run a business

If you are a sole trader or limited company director and cannot return to work, you may need to:

- reduce or change the kind of work you do
- speak to clients or partners about changing your work arrangements
- update HMRC about changes to your income
- explore retraining or changing your business model

You may be able to get:

- an Access to Work grant if you have a health condition or disability
- financial support from Business Debtline
- training and career advice from the National Careers Service
- tax support by telling HMRC about changes to your income. You may be able to reduce your tax bill or claim a refund, depending on your situation


### Get help and legal advice

You do not have to manage on your own. You can get free, confidential advice from:

- [ACAS](https://acas.org.uk/) – (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service) help with workplace problems and advice on your rights
- [Citizens Advice](https://citizensadvice.org.uk/) – guidance on your rights at work and help talking to your employer

Your trade union – if you are a member, they can support you and speak to your employer for you

### Consider retraining

If you cannot return to your old job, you may want to explore other types of work.
