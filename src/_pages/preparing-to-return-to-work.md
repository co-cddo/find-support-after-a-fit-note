## Preparing to return to work

Discuss with your employer if you’re able to return to work.

You can go back earlier than the end date on your fit note if you’re well enough. You do not have to see a healthcare professional again to go back to work.

You employer must discuss with you how they can help you return.

You can use the [Health Adjustment Passport](https://gov.uk/government/publications/health-adjustment-passport/) form when talking with your employer.

It helps you identify what help or changes you need to return to work or stay in work. For example, you may:

- need a [phased return](https://acas.org.uk/returning-to-work-after-absence/phased-return-to-work/), flexible or part-time working
- need some [reasonable adjustments](https://gov.uk/reasonable-adjustments-for-disabled-workers/) before you can go back
- want to apply for an [Access to Work](https://gov.uk/access-to-work/) grant, which will pay for support you need to stay in your job
- speak to an occupational health adviser in your organisation
- have to meet certain rules before you can return after illness, for example, if you drive a lorry or bus, [find out about driving with a medical condition](https://gov.uk/driving-medical-conditions/)

If your employer wants to dismiss you on sick leave, read about [your rights](/if-you-cannot-return-or-your-employer-wants-to-dismiss-you/).

There are also organisations who can advise and help you liaise with your employer:

- [Get help with talking to your employer from Citizens Advice](https://citizensadvice.org.uk/work/negotiating-with-your-employer/dealing-with-a-problem-at-work/)
- [Get free advice on returning to work after absence from ACAS](https://acas.org.uk/returning-to-work-after-absence/)
