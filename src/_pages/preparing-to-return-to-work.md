## Preparing to return to work

You can go back to work before the end date on your fit note if you feel well enough. You do not need to see a healthcare professional again unless your employer or industry requires it.

### If you are employed

Talk to your employer about how they can support your return. By law, your employer must consider how to help you return to work safely.

You might:

- return in stages (called a phased return)
- work fewer hours or flexible hours for a while
- need some reasonable adjustments to your job or workplace
- speak to an occupational health adviser (if your employer has one)

You can use the [Health Adjustment Passport](https://gov.uk/government/publications/health-adjustment-passport/) to help identify what support you need.

You may also be able to get an [Access to Work](https://gov.uk/access-to-work/) grant, which will pay for support you need to stay in work.

If your job involves safety rules, for example, if you drive a lorry or bus, [check the medical rules for driving](https://gov.uk/health-conditions-and-driving/).

 If your employer is considering ending your employment while you’re off sick, [read about your rights while off work sick](https://gov.uk/time-off-for-dependants/).

### If you are self-employed or run a business

If you’re a sole trader or run your own limited company, you won’t have an employer to talk to, but you might still need to:

- adjust your workload or client commitments
- get advice on financial or business support if you’re not ready to return
- speak to HMRC if your income or ability to work is affected

You can also apply for an [Access to Work](https://gov.uk/access-to-work/) grant if you need support to continue working with a health condition or disability.
