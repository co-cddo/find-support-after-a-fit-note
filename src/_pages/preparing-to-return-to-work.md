## Preparing to return to work

Whether you’re employed, self-employed or run your own business, there is support to help you get back to work after time off for a health condition.

### If you are employed

Talk to your employer about returning to work. You can go back earlier than the end date on your fit note if you feel well enough — you don’t need another appointment with your doctor.

Your employer should work with you to make your return easier. You could:

- ask for a phased return or flexible hours
- request reasonable adjustments to your role or working environment
- apply for an [Access to Work](https://gov.uk/access-to-work/) grant to help cover practical support
- speak to an occupational health adviser if your organisation has one
- check if there are specific rules for your job — for example, if you drive a lorry or bus, check medical conditions and driving rules

You can use the [Health Adjustment Passport form](https://gov.uk/government/publications/health-adjustment-passport/) to help plan your return. It can guide conversations with your employer about what support you may need.

### If you’re self-employed or run a business

If you’re a sole trader or run your own limited company, you might still need to gradually restart your work, adapt how you operate, or seek outside support — even if there’s no formal employer involved.

You could:

- adjust your working hours or take on lighter duties
- apply for an [Access to Work](https://gov.uk/access-to-work/) grant to help pay for specialist equipment or a support worker
- speak to a business mentor or local enterprise adviser about managing workload
- use the [Health Adjustment Passport](https://gov.uk/government/publications/health-adjustment-passport/) to reflect on your needs and make a plan
- get advice from your accountant or business network about phased return to work

### Know your rights

If you’re employed and your employer is considering ending your contract due to illness, it’s important to know your rights:

- [Get advice from Citizens Advice](https://citizensadvice.org.uk/work/sick-or-disabled-people-and-work/if-youre-sick-or-disabled-and-youre-employed/)
- [Free guidance from ACAS (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service) on going back to work](https://acas.org.uk/absence-from-work/)
