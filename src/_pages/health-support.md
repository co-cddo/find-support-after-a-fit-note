## Health support

Talk with your healthcare professional about support you can get for your condition.

You might qualify for a [personal health budget](https://nhs.uk/nhs-services/help-with-health-costs/what-is-a-personal-health-budget/) from the NHS to support you with treatment, equipment and personal care.

If youâ€™re eligible for it, an NHS local team will work with you to plan how to spend the money on your care.
